Vacation time is all about relaxing. But what makes a good relaxing activity?

During my own vacation to New Orleans, my favorite ways to relax are:

* Twiddling with new Ruby ideas
* Starting to write Sonic Pi notes
* Bringing my personal site back to Jekyll (ugh...)
* Reading old and new books
* Walking in Audobon Park until my legs scream

My favorite ways to relax here are (mostly) simple things that keep my mind at a gentle hum instead of at full throttle. I'll indulge in an episode or two of Bones, but eventually my brain gets antsy. A life without thought, however small, feels like a wasted one.
