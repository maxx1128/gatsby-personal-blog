[A recent Existential Comic about stoic dating](http://existentialcomics.com/comic/264) made me ponder a stoic way to be thankful. Having read plenty of stoic philosophy before, I figure it'd go like this:

1. Take the top five things in life you're grateful for.
2. Imagine life without each of them, one at a time, and all the stress and misery that'd cause you.
3. **Stop imagining these scenarios with a blend of gratefulness for still having them, and misery for realizing how they'll eventually leave your life.**
4. Continue after Thanksgiving with a fresh perspective on the fragility of everything we love in life.

I think if we're going to practice thankfulness, we should take it seriously!
