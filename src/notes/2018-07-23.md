We all know we've inherited instinctual behaviors from our ancestors. We crave fatty foods, have sex drives, have a "fight or flight" mode, etc. But maybe people can inherit more.

What if people could inherit moral ideas and instincts? Things like a powerful desire for truth, hatred of injustice, or a wish to help the poor. Like our innate reactions to things like food, some ideas could have been so influential in someone's life they was genetically passed down. There they'd unconsciously influence our thoughts and actions. **We'd never know it, but this way our ancestors could still guide us.**

Next time you reflect on a personal principle or truth, it could've been passed down to you. A guidepost passed down to help us navigate this messy world.

I like to think all that's true. It shows we can all offer something valuable to the next generation.
