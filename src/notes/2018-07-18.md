Something all the real people I respect I have in common is they pour their passion into something that helps others. Sometimes more than one thing.

* [Laura Kalbag](https://laurakalbag.com/) and [Aral Balkan](https://ar.al/) for a more ethical web
* [Heydon Pickering](http://www.heydonworks.com/) for greater web accessibility
* [Rachel Nabors](http://rachelnabors.com/) for better inclusivity and diversity in the web industry
* [Bill Coplin](https://twitter.com/TheHappyProf) for college students learning useful career skills
* [Adam Conover](https://twitter.com/adamconover) for inspiring a mixture of humor and curiosity in others

It's ideal since these passions likely bring them satisfaction (and a living) while leaving a positive imprint.

The hardest part of my career is finding a passion like that.
