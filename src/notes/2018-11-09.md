"Death Stalks Kettle Street" is one of my favorite novels for many reasons. Chief among them is an idea captured in this quote:

---

**There were lots of so-called able-bodied people who were more 'disabled' than she was simply because they chose to sit around, letting their health suffer, watching television or playing videogames twelve hours out of every twenty-four. How many people couldn't write a coherent sentence, not because they had learning difficulties, but because they just couldn't be bothered to learn, and were content to have the only book they owned be the Argos catalogue?**

*~ Death Stalks Kettle Street, 211*

I remember this on days I'm being too lazy. Not making proper use of my time to do something meaningful is wasteful, bordering on cruel to myself.
