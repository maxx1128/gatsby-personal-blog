title: "Do I Deserve What I Have?"
postType: note
---

Whenever life is going well, I'll ask myself one thing: **do I deserve any of this?**

The most likely answer I can think of is, I probably don't. Maybe I never will. But the bigger point is that regardless, I have what I have. I better make good use of it. In some way.

Any way.

Please.

Because if I don't, these feelings of guilt and undeservedness won't just get worse. They'll be justified.
